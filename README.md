# Yo! I'm OakarOo 👋 (but you can call me Mykal if that's easier to remember)

*Full-stack developer in Bangkok who occasionally remembers to hydrate while coding*  

**Current Status:**  
✔️ Coding at 2am because "just one more feature"  
✔️ Forgot to push latest changes yesterday (oops)  

## 🔥 What's Cooking?

### Feelio (MERN Stack) - [![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/Mykal-Steele/Adorio.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/Mykal-Steele/Adorio)
*"The project that made me question my life choices"*  
🍳 **Frontend:** React + Redux (still fighting with useSelector hooks)  
🥘 **Backend:** Express + MongoDB (Mongoose validations: 1, Me: 0) 
🌶️ **Real Pain Points:**  
- WebSocket connections dropping when my coffee shop WiFi acts up 
- React Quill editor sometimes eats my formatted text (hungry boi)  
- That one Redux action that works... but only on Tuesdays?  

*Latest Win:* Got file uploads working... as long as you don't try PDFs yet.  
*Latest Lose:* File uploads stopped working...

### Unity Chess Clock ♟️
*Because normal chess clocks are for normies*  
- Accidentally made timer go backwards once (feature, not bug!)  
- UI looks like Windows 95 (retro vibes ✨)  
- Secret cheat code: press Alt+Q three times (don't tell anyone)  

### Java University Stuff 📚
*When they say "OOP is fun" but you're just making yet another BankAccount class*  
- Professor keeps saying "encapsulation" like it's not just fancy getters/setters  
- Got 73/100 on last assignment because "magic numbers" (they weren't even that magical)  

## 🛠️ Tech Toolbox (Mostly Works... Sometimes)

### Backend Stuff
- Node.js/Express (router.get('/', (req, res) => { /* pray */ }))  
- MongoDB (I promise I'll learn proper indexing... someday)  
- WebSockets (Because polling is for the patient) 
- Testing? Yeah I do `console.log('it works')` sometimes  

### Frontend Circus
- React (Hooks! Context! ...Why is state undefined??)  
- Tailwind CSS (div className="flex flex-col justify-... wait how does this work again")  
- Framer Motion (makes things wiggle - 10/10 would animate again)  

### Game Dev Dabbles
- Unity (Where 50% of time is scripting, 50% fixing lighting)  
- Proud creator of "RotatingCube2023" (v2 coming never)  

## 📖 Learning... Slowly

✅ MongoDB: Trying to remember `$push` vs `$addToSet`  
✅ Express Middleware: That thing that runs before... something?  
✅ React: "Why isn't my useEffect dependency array working?!"   
✅ TypeScript types that somehow make everything `any` eventually 

## 👋 Hit Me Up!
