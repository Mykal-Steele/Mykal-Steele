# Yo! I'm OakarOo (Kruskal works too)

Full-stack developer in Bangkok. I try to stay hydrated, especially when coding late.

**Current Status:**
* Coding deep into the night ("just one more feature," you know?)
* Probably forgot to push some changes yesterday.

## What I'm Working On

### Feelio (MERN Stack)
*A project that's been... educational.*

* **Frontend:** React + Redux (still figuring out some `useSelector` quirks)
* **Backend:** Express + MongoDB (Mongoose validations and I have a complicated relationship)
* **Challenges:**
    * Occasional WebSocket drops when the coffee shop WiFi gets moody.
    * React Quill sometimes eats my formatting.
    * That one Redux action that works... inconsistently.

* **Recent Wins:** Got file uploads mostly working (PDFs are next on the list).
* **Recent Setbacks:** File uploads decided to take a break.

### Unity Chess Clock ‚ôüÔ∏è
*A slightly unconventional chess clock.*

* Accidentally implemented a reverse timer (let's call it a feature).
* Rocking a retro Windows 95-inspired UI.
* There's a secret cheat code (Alt+Q, three times‚Äîshhh!).

### Java University Projects üìö
*Navigating the world of OOP.*

* Trying to fully grasp "encapsulation" beyond getters and setters.
* Learning to avoid "magic numbers" (even if they feel magical).

## Tech I Use

### Backend
* Node.js/Express (routing that sometimes feels like a prayer)
* MongoDB (working on my indexing game)
* WebSockets (because real-time is cool)
* Testing: Mostly `console.log` for now.

### Frontend
* React (hooks, context, the usual... and the occasional "why is this undefined?")
* Tailwind CSS (flexbox is still a puzzle sometimes)
* Framer Motion (making things move is fun)

### Game Dev
* Unity (where scripting and lighting battles consume my time)
* Creator of "RotatingCube2023" (a masterpiece, if I do say so myself).

## Currently Learning

* MongoDB: Mastering `$push` vs `$addToSet`.
* Express Middleware: Figuring out the order of operations.
* React: Debugging `useEffect` dependency arrays.
* TypeScript: Making types more specific (and less `any`).

## Let's Connect!

* Want to collaborate on a project?
* Feel like sharing some code feedback?
* Can explain Webpack without making my head spin?

üìß **Email:** mykal.stele@gmail.com (yeah, I know, the typo.)

*P.S. If you're emailing about blockchain or NFTs, expect cat memes.*

*I may have a slight obsession with GitHub's green shades.*
